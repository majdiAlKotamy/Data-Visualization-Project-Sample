# Pandas Data Visualization
Pandas offers built-in functionalities for creating basic visualizations directly from your DataFrame, leveraging the power of Matplotlib under the hood.
Here's a breakdown of some common visualizations:

1. Imports and Data Preparation:
Import libraries: import pandas as pd and import matplotlib.pyplot as plt (usually shortened to plt).
Load your data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Visualizing Distributions:
Histogram: Use df['column_name'].plot.hist(). Adjust bin sizes with the bins parameter.
Box Plot: Create box plots using df.boxplot()

3. Exploring Relationships:
Scatter Plot: Visualize relationships between two columns using df.plot.scatter(x='column1', y='column2').

4. Categorical Data Analysis:
Bar Charts: Represent data grouped by categories using df['column_name'].value_counts().plot.bar().
Pie Charts: Show proportional distribution of categories using df['column_name'].value_counts().plot.pie().

6. Customization and Saving:
Customize plot elements like labels, titles, and legend using Matplotlib functions within the plot method.
Save visualizations as images using plt.savefig("plot.png").


Key Points:
These are basic examples, and Pandas offers various plot types like line plots, area plots, and more.
For more advanced visualizations and customizations, consider using dedicated libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
